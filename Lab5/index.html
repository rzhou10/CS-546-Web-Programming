        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Renjie, a senior computer engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am originally from Lawrenceville, NJ. I am planning on getting a full time
            job after I graduate in May 2019 with an interest in software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm striving to make myself a better person, and willing to make the most out of senior year. I hope to be able to succeed in life as a result of this.
